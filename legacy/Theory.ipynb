    "\n",
    "In real markets, the bootstrapping algorithm is applied to **actual traded instruments** (Treasury bills, notes, bonds, swaps) whose **prices and yields come from the market** (e.g. Bloomberg, Refinitiv, broker feeds).  \n",
    "Those raw quotes are then cleaned and used to construct an arbitrage-free zero-coupon curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I **don’t have direct access** to that kind of professional market-data feed.  \n",
    "I *do* have FRED data for **3M, 6M, 1Y Treasuries**, which are effectively **zero-coupon (bill) yields**, and I will treat these as a **“true” short-end zero curve** for intuition and comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to **implement and test the bootstrapping algorithm itself**, I also need a set of **coupon-paying bonds** (e.g. 2Y, 3Y, 5Y notes) with given coupons and prices.  \n",
    "Since I can’t easily pull a clean set of real Treasury bond quotes programmatically, I will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Construct a small universe of **synthetic Treasury-like coupon bonds** (with realistic coupons and prices) directly in code/CSV.\n",
    "- **Other options I have but seem difficult for now**:\n",
    "  - Reconstructing bonds from public par curves (those are already bootstrapped, so I’d be re-bootstrapping a bootstrapped curve).\n",
    "  - Using a professional data vendor or broker API (too heavy / not accessible for this learning project).\n",
    "\n",
    "This choice keeps the project **conceptually honest** and **technically focused**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I **clearly separate**:\n",
    "  - The *source of prices* (here: synthetic but realistic coupon bonds),\n",
    "  - From the *algorithm* (bootstrapping those prices into a zero-coupon curve).\n",
    "- The synthetic bonds are **not arbitrary**; they are designed to look like real Treasury notes (maturities, coupons, price levels).\n",
    "- In a real bank, the **same mathematical algorithm** I code here would be used, but the input prices would come from live market-data feeds instead of synthetic data."
